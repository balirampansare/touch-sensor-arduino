# touch-sensor-arduino


Touch sensor detects touch that makes the led to glow along with buzzer starts to buzz. Its a demo of how we can use touch sensor technology for our door or luggage securtiy.

Touch sensor Types
- Capacitive Touch Sensor
- Resistive Touch Sensor
- Infrared Touch Senssor

In this project we are going to deal with capacitive touch sensor.

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino UNO 
- Arduino UNO USB Cable
- Capacitive Touch Sensor
- Breadboard
- Jumper Wires
- Red Led Bulb
- Buzzer
- Battery or a cable for power source

## Software Requirements
Arduino IDE [download](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

Deploy the code on Arduino UNO board

## Hardware Connections
Capacitive Touch Sensor:
- SIG Pin to D3 Pin of the arduino uno board
- Vcc Pin to 5V Pin of the arduino uno board
- GND Pin to GND Pin of the arduino uno board

Led Connection
- Led +ve Pin to D13 of the arduino uno board
- Led -ve Pin to GND of the arduino uno board

Buzzer Connection
- Buzzer +ve Pin to D12 of the arduino uno board
- Buzzer -ve Pin to GND of the arduino uno board

Connect the power source

The successful deploy of the code and hardware connections, on sense of touch the led with glow and buzzer will start to buzz
